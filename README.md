## Project Overview
In this analysis, we set out to explore trends in NBA scheduling.

## Dataset
[NBA Data 2010-2014](https://github.com/NocturneBear/NBA-Data-2010-2024)

This GitHub repository contains CSV files containing  NBA data spanning from the 2010-11 season to 2023-24 season, offering valuable insights into player statistics, team performances, game outcomes, and more.

## Questions
1) From 2010 to 2024, what is the average number of 4-in-6 stretches for a season?

   27.2 4-in-6 stretches on average from 2010-11 to 2023-24. We can see that the NBA has started to decrease the number of 4-in-6 stretches in recent seasons. There was a peak during the 2020 season due to COVID-19 where the regular season was reduced from its standard 82 games to 72 games.

3) How does a team's likelihood of winning change when playing on the second night of back-to-back (b2b) games?

      On the second night of b2b games, teams are losing 55.7% of the time and winning only 44.3%. This suggests that playing on consecutive nights put teams at a disadvantage due to fatigue and travel time.

4) Probability of winning/losing at home games
  - The probability of a team winning a game at home is 57.64%.
  - The probability of a team losing a game at home is 42.36%.
