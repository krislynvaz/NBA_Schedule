## Project Overview
In this analysis, we set out to explore trends in NBA scheduling.

## Dataset
[NBA Data 2010-2014](https://github.com/NocturneBear/NBA-Data-2010-2024)

This GitHub repository contains CSV files containing  NBA data spanning from the 2010-11 season to 2023-24 season, offering valuable insights into player statistics, team performances, game outcomes, and more.

## Questions
1) From 2010 to 2024, what is the average number of 4-in-6 stretches for a season?

27.2 4-in-6 stretches on average from 2010-11 to 2023-24. We can see that the NBA has started to decrease the number of 4-in-6 stretches in recent seasons. There was a peak during the 2020 season due to COVID-19 where the regular season was reduced from its standard 82 games to 72 games.

3) How has Lewis Hamiltonâ€™s performance evolved over time?
4) Which nationalities dominate Formula 1 wins?
5) Which constructors have the most podium finishes?
6) How have 2019 rookies progressed in F1?
7) Does starting in pole position significantly increase chances of winning?
8) Can we predict whether a driver will finish on the podium?
